Imagine your fur, fluffed by a warm breeze as you lay upon a high rock perch garnished with moss from the adjacent bonzai tree. You feel the calm, the subtle flowing energy of being, the essence of movement. You cannot help but explore further, unfold your purrpose, discover the flow state others have tread before you. Soak in the depth of the communal conscience.
